Welcome to qusi's documentation!
================================

Installation
------------

To install ``qusi`` with Python >= 3.11 use:

.. code:: shell

    pip install qusi

Although not required, as is generally good practice for any development project, we highly recommend creating a separate virtual environment for each distinct project. For example, via Conda, creating a virtual environment for a project using ``qusi`` might look like:

.. code::

    conda create -n project_using_qusi_env python=3.11

Then before working, be sure to activate your environment:

.. code:: shell

    conda activate project_using_qusi_env

Then install ``qusi`` within this environment.
