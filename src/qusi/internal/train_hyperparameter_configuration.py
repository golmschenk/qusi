    Hyperparameter configuration settings for a train session.

                  steps. They can be seen as analogous to epochs. However, as qusi datasets are often
                  infinite or have different length sub-collections, there is not always the exact equivalent of an
                  epoch, so cycles are used instead.
    :ivar train_steps_per_cycle: The number of training steps per cycle.
    :ivar validation_steps_per_cycle: The number of validation steps per cycle.
    :ivar batch_size: The size of the batch for each train process. Each training step will use a number of observations
        equal to this value multiplied by the number of train processes.
    :ivar learning_rate: The learning rate.
    :ivar optimizer_epsilon: The epsilon to be used by the optimizer.
    :ivar weight_decay: The weight decay of the optimizer.
